# OOP-Chess
An OOP approach to chess.

All pieces working, with a check and checkmate system.

The board is on terminal, and asks the user a set of instructions asking the desired initial and final location of their pieces.
It utilises input validation for this, then iterates over the board to check for check and checkmate.
